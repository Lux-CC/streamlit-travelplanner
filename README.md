Helps me do my travel planning

# todo:

- batch edit to top view
- limit rerenders
  o figure out how i can control popup show=true?
  o why is it rerendered in the first place when i click popup?
  o how does session_state lifecycle work? does it work different from passing function output? (e.g. call function x where function x either returns a value, or updates a session state var, which is then accessed later in the file?)
